This is a node.js/express app for kicking the tyres on Singly's API.

Mostly cribbed from https://github.com/beaugunderson/vacatio

Everything is in env vars, Heroku style.

You need the following settings in a `.env` file to run locally:

    SERVER_URL=http://yourapp.example.com
    SINGLY_API_URL=https://api.singly.com
    SINGLY_CLIENT_ID=XXXXX
    SINGLY_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXX
    SESSION_SECRET=randomnoise
    REDISTOGO_URL=yourredissettings

For Heroku, leave off the REDISTOGO_URL and enable the redistogo addon instead:

    heroku addons:add redistogo

You can get the Singly credentials from http://dev.singly.com/
