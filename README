This is a node.js/express app for kicking the tyres on Singly's API. Mostly 
cribbed from https://github.com/beaugunderson/vacatio

All it does is let you log in (with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare,
Tumblr and/or Instagram) and see photos from you or your friends in a grid.

Still using Express 2.x for quick compat with my old install of Node.

Everything is in env vars, Heroku style. Assuming you have the Heroku tools 
and Redis running with the defaults, put the following settings in a `.env`
file and simply use `foreman start` to run locally:

    SINGLY_CLIENT_ID=XXXXX
    SINGLY_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXX
    SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
    SINGLY_API_URL=https://api.singly.com
    SESSION_SECRET=randomnoise
    REDISTOGO_URL=redis://localhost:6379

By default this will run on http://localhost:5000 - Singly doesn't mind if you
set up your app for a different host, so you can use your official public host
when you create your app.

For Heroku, run `heroku config:add THIS=THAT` for the above config vars, but 
leave off the REDISTOGO_URL and enable the redistogo addon instead:

    heroku addons:add redistogo

You can your Singly app credentials from http://dev.singly.com/
